data loader vs normal query
normal query :
we include all things in a single sql query to fetch everything 
adv
it is pretty simply 
it is pretty good for performance
disadv
we are always fetching the creator even if we do not require it in the posts.grpahql
and sometimes it is good to split out a query into multiple smaller query instead of a big query 

we are gonna add a field resolver so no matter where our posts comes from its going to fetch the data
